# windlidar
Code created for The Turbine Plays, to parse the online available data of lidar measurements of wind speeds.


The class code allows you to read out one or more datafiles from the KNMI platform at [https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/access/windlidar-nz-wp-platform-10min-1](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/access/windlidar-nz-wp-platform-10min-1) in SuperCollider.
Then the data can be accessed by type, and used to sonify the data.
